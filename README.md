# Low-Dose-CT-Radiomic
This repository consist the all source codes for paper"Improving the Reliability of Radiomic based on Low Dose CT by Using Generative Models", this project aim at improving the reliability of radiomic based on low dose CT. The core main idea of this project is improving the quality of images at first and then calculate radiomic, improvment the image quality of low dose CT is equal to image denoising in some degree. Therefore, the content of this project is denoising low dose CT image for Radiomic calculating.
